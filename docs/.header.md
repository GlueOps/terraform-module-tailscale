# terraform-module-tailscale

A Terraform module for managing Tailscale ACL (Access Control List) configuration for Cloud Development Environment (CDE) infrastructure. This module provides a structured approach to managing network access policies for multiple entities with separate production and non-production environments.

## Features

- **Multi-entity Support**: Manages access policies for multiple entities (e.g., apple, google, netflix)
- **Environment Separation**: Distinct prod and nonprod environments with appropriate access controls
- **Shared Resources**: Configurable shared resources with environment-specific access
- **Bastion Host Access**: Secure SSH access through bastion hosts for each entity
- **Group-based Permissions**: Role-based access control with admin groups
- **Automated Tag Management**: Automatic generation of Tailscale tags for VMs and bastions

## Architecture

The module creates a comprehensive ACL configuration that includes:

- **VM Tags**: Separate tags for prod/nonprod VMs per entity (`tag:app-{env}-cde-vm-{entity}`)
- **Bastion Tags**: Separate tags for prod/nonprod bastions per entity (`tag:app-{env}-cde-bastion-{entity}`)
- **Shared Resource Tags**: Configurable tags for shared infrastructure
- **Access Rules**: Network access policies between components
- **SSH Rules**: Secure shell access controls

## Usage

```hcl
module "tailscale_acl" {
  source = "path/to/terraform-module-tailscale"

  tailnet_name = "your-tailnet-name"
  
  cde_entities = [
    "apple",
    "google", 
    "netflix"
  ]

  groups = {
    "group:sysadmins" = [
      "admin@example.com"
    ]
    "group:prod-cde-admins" = [
      "prod-admin@example.com"
    ]
    "group:nonprod-cde-admins" = [
      "nonprod-admin@example.com"
    ]
    "group:everyone" = [
      "user1@example.com",
      "user2@example.com"
    ]
  }

  shared_resources = {
    apple = {
      registry_cache = {
        tag         = "tag:shared-registry-cache-apple"
        description = "Shared registry cache for apple VMs"
        environment = "global"
        access = {
          ports = ["tcp:1111", "tcp:1112"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Access Patterns

The module implements several access patterns:

1. **Admin Access**: Sysadmins have full access to all tagged resources
2. **Environment-specific Access**: Prod/nonprod admins can only access their respective environments
3. **Bastion-to-VM Access**: Bastions can SSH to VMs within the same entity and environment
4. **Shared Resource Access**: VMs can access shared resources based on environment compatibility
5. **Internet Access**: All users can access the internet through Tailscale

## Shared Resources

Shared resources can be configured with three environment types:

- **global**: Accessible by both prod and nonprod VMs
- **prod**: Only accessible by production VMs
- **nonprod**: Only accessible by non-production VMs
